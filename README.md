In this project, you’ll be building a frontend-only website using the technologies that you have learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development. You can either choose to use the example brief below or choose to use your idea for the website.
CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND

    Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
    The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
        Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
        Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
    The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
        Photos of the band members
        A video clip
        Audio clips
    Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.






 User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project (UCFDMP)
 
 Hi there! Welcome to my code institute UCFDMP
 
 In this project brief I have chosen to create my own scenario based on the scenario provided. My project will focus on an up and coming artist 
 I will build a static (front-end only) website for the artist. 

The artist has been around for about 5 years and has experience of performing live at numerous events in Ghana. 
I have taken the scenario of being given the following requirements for the project. 
    - His primary target audiences are his fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from is tours around Ghana, 
    as well as new material as it becomes available.
    - He would like to use the site to showcase his music and publicise his availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
    
    He has provided me, the developer, with the following assets that he would like to showcase on his website:
        - Photos
        - Video and Audio Clips
        - Also, he has social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
        

I intend to use no wireframes but a configuration already existing in the code institute git hub libraries under 
UserCentricFrontendDevelopment-Resume/18-providing_a_cv_for_download/ see the link to the project below

----------------------------

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features

    Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
    ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement

    Another feature idea

Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

    JQuery
        The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
